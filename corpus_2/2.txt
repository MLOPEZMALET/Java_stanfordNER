Sally had a very exciting summer vacation. She went to summer camp for the first time. She
made friends with a girl named Tina. They shared a bunk bed in their cabin. Sally's
favorite activity was walking in the woods because she enjoyed nature. Tina liked arts and
crafts. Together they made some art using leaves they found in the woods. Even after she
fell in the water Sally still enjoyed canoeing. She was sad when the camp was over but
promised to keep in touch with her new friend.

Sally went to the beach with her family in the summer as well. She loves the beach. Sally
collected shells and mailed some to her friend Tina so she could make some arts and
crafts with them. Sally liked fishing with her brothers cooking on the grill with her dad
and swimming in the ocean with her mother.
