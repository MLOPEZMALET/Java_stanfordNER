Todd lived in a town outside the city . Unlike the city the town was peaceful and quiet
and full of trees flowers and animals.  One day his dad came in from work and said "Come
on son I'm going to take you to the city." Todd was very exited so he put on his shoes
and ran to the car.  When they got to the city Todd was very surprised there were so many
cars and people everyone seemed to be in a hurry. There were no trees no flowers and no
animals. Todd was so happy to get back home.  When his mom asked him about his trip to the
