Mike and Jeff are close friends. Their school is having a guessing game to guess how many
gumballs are in a box. If they get the right amount they win $100. If they get close they
get a $20 gift card. The box looks like it is missing some gumballs. It turns out some
people are eating them when they place their guess. 100 people guessed and took a piece of
candy. The box is 10" by 10" by 10". Each gumball is 1" each. Mike guessed 500. Jeff
guessed 800. They both said they would split their money they win if they win.
