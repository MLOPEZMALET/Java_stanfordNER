Sara wanted to play on a baseball team. She had never tried to swing a bat and hit a
baseball before. Her Dad gave her a bat and together they went to the park to
practice. Sara wondered if she could hit a ball. She wasn't sure if she would be any
good. She really wanted to play on a team and wear a real uniform. She couldn't wait to
get to the park and test out her bat. When Sara and her Dad reached the park Sara grabbed
the bat and stood a few steps away from her Dad. Sara waited as her Dad pitched the ball
to her. Her heart was beating fast. She missed the first few pitches. She felt like
quitting but kept trying. Soon she was hitting the ball very far. She was very happy and
she couldn't wait to sign up for a real team. Her Dad was very proud of her for not giving
up.
