On a nice and sunny day Bob and Sally walked to the beach. When they got there the first
thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had
brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with
their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour they didn't find
anything. This made Bob and Sally very sad. They gave up and went to play in the
water. While they were playing in the water Sally found a bottle with a little paper
inside. Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map. Sally showed the map to Bob and
they started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said they
started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole they found a
box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. Bob slowly
opened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next they ran to a special store to ask
about the pearl. The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them
rich. Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl
home and saved it in a special box so they could remember their day at the beach.
