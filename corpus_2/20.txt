I'm here to tell you the story of a robot named Carl. He came from a far away land known as
Factory. Carl was sad because he was missing a part called a tire. He also needed a sun
gatherer. But the tire was more important. Once Carl got all these parts he could travel
to his new home in the nation of Lab and the city of Office. It was a tricky thing to get
there with missing parts. Just as he had given up hope Carl got a message from Mr. X
saying the new parts were ready to be delivered. This made the robot very happy. The parts
arrived a few days later and Carl put them in with 2 days of work. After this Carl began
to travel the last bit of his goal to get to his new job. After this Carl took 10 days to
get to Lab.
