Three little kids lived in a great big house with a great big cat and many places for a
great big cat to hide.  Their great big cat was named Cowboy.  And Cowboy was not a very
nice cat.  Cowboy liked to bite and chew and scratch a great many things.  When Cowboy was
happy which was not very often Cowboy liked to bite in to a blanket or soft toy and
carry it around in his mouth.  When Cowboy was hungry he liked to bite bright red tomatoes
and suck out all the juice and seeds.  And when Cowboy was feeling mean he liked to hide.
Cowboy would hide curled up tight in a ball under a blanket or behind a corner and wait
for one of the little kids to pass by.  When they did pass by Cowboy would jump at their
feet and try to bite and scratch them.  He did not know that what he was doing was not
very nice.  Cowboy was only a cat.  A great big cat that did not know any better.
