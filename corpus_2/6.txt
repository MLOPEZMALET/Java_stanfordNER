Once upon a time there a little girl named Ana. Ana was a smart girl. Everyone in Ana's
school knew and liked her very much. She had a big dream of becoming spelling bee
winner. Ana studied very hard to be the best she could be at spelling. Ana's best friend
would help her study every day after school. By the time the spelling bee arrived Ana and
her best friend were sure she would win. There were ten students in the spelling bee. This
made Ana very nervous but when she looked out and saw her dad cheering her on she knew
she could do it. The spelling bee had five rounds and Ana made it through them all. She
was now in the finals. During the final round James the boy she was in the finals with was
given a really hard word and he spelled it wrong. All Ana had to do was spell this last
word and she would be the winner. Ana stepped to the microphone thought really hard and
spelled the word. She waited and finally her teacher said "That is correct". Ana had won
the spelling bee. Ana was so happy. She won a trophy. Ana also won a big yellow
ribbon. The whole school was also happy and everyone clapped for her. The whole school
went outside. They had a picnic to celebrate Ana winning.
