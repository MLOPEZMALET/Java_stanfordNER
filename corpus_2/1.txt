It was Jessie Bear's birthday. She was having a party.  She asked her two best friends to
come to the party.  She made a big cake and hung up some balloons.

Soon her friend Lion came over. Then her friend Tiger came over. Lion and Tiger brought
presents with them.

Jessie hugged her friends. She asked them if they would like to have cake. 

Yes! said Lion. Yes yes! said Tiger. Jessie cut the cake and they all ate it together.
