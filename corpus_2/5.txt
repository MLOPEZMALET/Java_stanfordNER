My parents Kelly and Kelley said that it was that time of year to take a family
vacation.  We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  This year my
parents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.

After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the
long car ride there.
  
Once we arrive the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much to
see and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool movie theater and an elevator to take
us from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the whole
place to our family!
  
We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places.
There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  My brother Kelsey and I
played hide and go seek for hours watched movies and swam until the sun went down.

It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories.
We'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle!
