One day Magneson took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond
was a duck named George.  George's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy.

Magneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn
Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before the
squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.  He was knocked out and the
squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.

Magneson asked what their son's name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was
only making small talk.  He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if
there was one there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He
could also hide in the tall grass.

George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away singing
a sad song.  A short time later the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant
walnut at Magneson.  No one ever saw Magneson again.
